This is a Spotify API wrapper written in Golang. I created this to learn the basics of Golang. The API wrapper is not fully implemented - I only wrapped portions of the API that were useful to me. This portion excludes any user specific data and therefore I have not implemented any of the necessary authorization flows to retrieve that data. This project leans heavily on the seemingly most popular Spotify Go Wrapper found [here](https://github.com/zmb3/spotify).
